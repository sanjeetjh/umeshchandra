        His paternal grandfather, Sri Chadalavada Umamaheshwara Rao, was a leader of the Justice Party of India, and his selfless service inspired Umesh Chandra to imbibe similar ideals. As the eldest grandson of Sri Tummala Jaganmohan Rao, he received much love and affection from his extended family, which he reciprocated towards his siblings and cousins. He showed respect for elders and affection for everyone.
